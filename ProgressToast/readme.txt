Basic user input - Display a progress toast

========================================================================
Sample Description:

 The ProgressToast Sample is an application that is designed to show you how to
 display a progress toast in your application. This sample uses the dialog
 service, which is a service in the BlackBerry Platform Services library. You
 can use the dialog service to create various dialogs and set the properties for
 these dialogs, such as title, message, available buttons, and so on. You can
 also use this service to retrieve information about the dialog button that a
 user pressed.

 When you run the application, it starts with an progress toast already present.
 After you have closed the progress toast or if it closes after a timeout, you
 can later display another progress toast by swiping down from the top of the
 screen. Swiping down also increases the progress level of the progress toast.
 Swiping down to increase the progress level will work while the dialog is still
 showing.
